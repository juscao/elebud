            I. What advantages can Elebud provide over professional software
            like Microsoft Excel?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our application has an extremely low barrier to entry and is
            completely free to use. If you don't like it, no harm doneâ€”you can
            always explore another application that better suits your needs.

          <h2>III. Why is the logo an elephant?</h2>
          <p>
            I was just brainstorming names and things like "Finance Cat" popped
            into my mind, but I recently went to Cambodia and the elephant is
            extremely prominent in their culture so I thought to do something
            with that. The "bud" is short for budget. It's easy to say and easy
            to remember.
